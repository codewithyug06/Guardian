# Guardian | Strategic Risk Intelligence
**Autonomous. Behavioral. Predictive. Self-Healing.**


## 🛡️ Project Overview
**Guardian** is a next-generation **Autonomous Risk Intelligence** framework designed to bridge the "Compliance Velocity Gap." In an era where global regulations evolve faster than human teams can parse them, Guardian leverages a decentralized **Multi-Agent Swarm** to transition from passive monitoring to proactive, self-healing assurance.

Traditional RegTech acts as a thermometer—it records the crisis after it happens. **Guardian acts as the thermostat**, autonomously discovering regulatory shifts, mapping them to internal policies, and executing edge-level enforcement to neutralize financial and legal liability in real-time.

## 🚀 Key Advancements
Guardian integrates state-of-the-art Generative AI and Agentic workflows to deliver unique capabilities that outperform traditional monitoring tools:

* **Agentic Semantic Discovery**: Proactively scans and interprets global rulebooks (PCI-DSS, GDPR, AML) to extract operational obligations rather than just keywords.
* **Strategic RAG Pipeline**: Ingests internal policy documentation and instantly identifies control gaps against external mandates using high-fidelity Retrieval-Augmented Generation.
* **Financial Impact Modeling**: Translates technical vulnerabilities into business reality by autonomously calculating **Estimated Financial Liability** (e.g., "$100,000/mo potential fine").
* **Behavioral Velocity Analysis**: Detects high-speed anomalies and "structuring" patterns that static monitors miss, identifying systemic risks across overlapping domains.
* **Temporal Risk Projection**: Simulates risk trajectories over a 30-day window to visualize the "Future Risk Curve," enabling proactive threat neutralization.
* **Autonomous Self-Healing Loop**: Executes edge-level "Kill-Switches" to block non-compliant transactions while autonomously patching internal control libraries.

## 🧠 The Agent Swarm
Guardian's "Brain" is divided into specialized nodes that collaborate through a decentralized orchestration layer:

> **The Scout Node (Discovery)**
> Performs autonomous scanning and interprets the "spirit" of the law with verified confidence scoring. It replaces manual regulatory reading with instant semantic parsing.

> **The Sentry Node (Behavioral)**
> Monitors operational telemetry for behavioral anomalies and systemic, cross-domain violations. It identifies "Velocity Attacks" that standard rules miss.

> **The Architect Node (Strategy)**
> Maps findings to internal gaps and translates technical debt into quantified **Financial Liability ($)**. It connects the technical problem to the business bottom line.

> **The Prophet Node (Forecasting)**
> Simulates future risk trends and triggers the **Self-Healing Loop** for edge enforcement, visualizing how risks will compound over 30 days.
